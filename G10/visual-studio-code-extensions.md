# Visual Studio Code Extensions

## Extensions Along with Their Explanations:

`Better Comments`:

Usage: You can use Better Comments to provide more context and structure to your comments in code.

Example: Use // TODO: Finish this function to mark tasks that need to be completed, // FIXME: Fix this bug to flag issues, and // NOTE: This part needs optimization to highlight areas for improvement.

`Color Highlight:`

Usage: Color Highlight makes it easier to identify and work with colors directly within your code.

Example: When you enter a color value like #FF0000 or rgb(255, 0, 0), Color Highlight will display it as the corresponding color red.

`GitLens:`

Usage: GitLens enhances your Git workflow within Visual Studio Code.

Example: You can use GitLens to view commit history, compare changes between commits, and see who last modified a particular line of code using the Git blame feature.

`indent-rainbow:`

Usage: indent-rainbow helps visualize indentation levels in your code.

Example: As you indent code blocks using spaces or tabs, indent-rainbow will display each level of indentation with a different color, making it easier to see the structure of your code.

`Live Server:`

Usage: Live Server simplifies local web development by providing a live reloading development server.

Example: After installing Live Server, you can launch it with a single click and instantly see your changes reflected in the browser as you edit your HTML, CSS, or JavaScript files.

`One Dark Pro:`

Usage: One Dark Pro is a popular dark theme that enhances the appearance of Visual Studio Code.

Example: By selecting the One Dark Pro theme in Visual Studio Code settings, you can customize the editor's colors and make your coding environment more visually appealing.

`Material Icon Theme:`

Usage: Material Icon Theme adds colorful icons to files and folders in Visual Studio Code.

Example: With Material Icon Theme enabled, you can quickly identify file types and folder structures based on their associated icons, making navigation and organization easier.

`Path Intellisense:`

Usage: Path Intellisense provides auto-completion for filenames and paths in your code.

Example: When typing a file or directory path in your code, Path Intellisense will suggest matching filenames and directories, reducing typos and saving time.

`Prettier - Code Formatter:`

Usage: Prettier automatically formats your code according to predefined rules and styles.

Example: After installing Prettier, you can configure it to format your code on save or manually trigger formatting using keyboard shortcuts. This ensures consistent code style across your project.

`Rest Client:`

Usage: Rest Client allows you to send HTTP requests directly from within Visual Studio Code.

Example: You can write HTTP request scripts in a .http file, specifying request methods, headers, and bodies. Rest Client will execute these requests and display the responses directly in the editor, making it easy to test and debug APIs.
